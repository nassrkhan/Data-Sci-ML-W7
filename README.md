This repository contains a collection of R scripts exploring various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using different datasets, including classic text datasets like Jane Austen's books and custom text data.

The work covers:

Text Preprocessing: Stop words removal, stemming, lemmatization.
Text Representation: Document-Term Matrix (DTM), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
Text Visualization: Barplots, Wordclouds.
Topic Modeling: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover topics.
Sentiment Analysis: Calculating sentiment scores and visualizing them.
Word Embedding (Word2Vec): Creating vector representations, similarity, distance calculations, and visualizations in 2D.
Key libraries used: tm, SnowballC, textstem, wordcloud, topicmodels, sentimentr, word2vec, janeaustenr, lsa.
